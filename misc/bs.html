  <p>A lesson!</p>
  <p>A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree," sighed the turkey, but I haven't
    got the energy."
  </p>
  <p>"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull. "They're packed with nutrients."
  </p>
  <p>The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the
    tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he
    was proudlyperched at the top of the tree. Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.
  </p>
  <p>Moral of the story: Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.
